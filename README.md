## Description

RpgSkillable is a modification of the [rereskillable mod](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=rereskillable+curseforge) that was abandoned. Thanks to the license and permission statement of the author, this mod was possible.

Major differences in RpgSkillable include:
  Renaming and reduction of skills
  Additional configurability
  New textures
  New positive and negative effects
  Additional intergration with mods
  
This mod was developed with additional mods in mind, therefore to get the most out of it please consider playing with [Elenai Dodge 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elenai-dodge-2) and [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)
